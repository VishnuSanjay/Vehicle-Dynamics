1. Bill's primitive model doesn't include diff, aero effects. Kinematics can pla
y more of an effect based on specifics.
2. Why does steer and camber get added the same way in the compliance budget?
3. Why measure DR at tangent speed?
4. Why driver's front slip angle rate sensitivity(maxlatsim), and not derivative(nonlin)?
5. Out of phase?
6. Did we ever test in-phase at 4ze?
7. Pg.31 how these plots?
8. Ay response time long for high front compliance vehicle?
9. Why sideslip response to front cornering compliance?
10.
