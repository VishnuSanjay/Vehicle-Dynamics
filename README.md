# Vehicle-Dynamics
This repo contains code used to understand handling and performance of predominantly SAE cars, but can easily be generalised for other vehicles.


The current organization of the code will be:
* Tires
* Steering and suspension 
* Testing
* Full vehicle dynamics

The **Tires** folder contains tire data processing techniques and functions that will be called within the full vehicle dynamics simulations.

The **Steering and suspension** folder will contain files related to the kinematics of these systems.

The **Testing** folder will contain files related to test data processing of tests of real vehicles.

The **full vehicle dynamics** folder will contain files related to understanding performce of the vehicle via simulations. It is here that simulations of ISO handling procedures, and (later) lap time simulations will be located.
